Google LLC[5] is an American multinational technology company that specializes 
in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising 
technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is 
considered one of the Big Four technology companies, along with Amazon, Apple 
and Facebook.[6][7]

Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin 
while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. 
Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent 
of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated 
Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public 
offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its 
headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. 
In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests 
as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary 
and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. 
Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO 
of Alphabet.
